I recently graduated with my PhD in Oceanography from Dalhousie University in Halifax NS, Canada, where I was advised by [Dr. Keith Thompson](http://www.phys.ocean.dal.ca/people/po/Thompson/Thompson_Keith.html). In January, I will start a Postoctoral Fellowship in [Dr. Eric Oliver's Research Group](https://ecjoliver.weebly.com).

My primary research interests are climate variability and interactions across temporal/spatial scales and across sub-systems of the climate (e.g., ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere). I am particularly interested in combining observations with statistical and numerical models to improve our understanding of the climate system including questions of predictability and long-term trends.
