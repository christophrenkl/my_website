Christoph Renkl is an oceanographer and climate scientist at the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/). His research focuses on climate variability and ocean-atmosphere interactions across a variety of temporal and spatial scales. He is particularly interested in combining observations with statistical and numerical models to improve our understanding of the climate system including questions of predictability and long-term trends. Currently, he is a Postdoctoral Investigator in [Dr. Hyodae Seo’s research group](https://hseo.whoi.edu/) studying the impact of marine heatwaves on atmospheric rivers along the West Coast of North America using a regional coupled modeling system.
